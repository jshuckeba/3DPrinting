# 3DPrinting
Some resources from the Orlando Code Camp 2019 Basics of 3D Printing session.

Session materials (Cura profile, bed leveling GCode, and presentation, etc.) have been posted.

<b>It is worth noting that since my presentation I did find out that there is a type of nylon filament (called Nylon 230) which may be printed by lower end RepRap printers such as the Ender 3. According to manufacturers isn't as strong as the higher temperature nylon filaments but is still quite durable.</b> 

If you have questions or comments, please post an issue to this repo.
